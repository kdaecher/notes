2666 by Roberto Bola√±o

I wish I was still reading this book. 

The book is five parts. Each part has a different plot. The fifth part I thought I was reading Dostoevsky. It made me want to read Dostoevsky again. Probably because the fifth part takes place partly in Russia. 

I don't know if I can could recommend this book to other people because of the fourth part which is 300 pages of descriptions of horrible things happening to women. I think I felt a little depressed when I was reading that part.
