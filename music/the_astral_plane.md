The Astral Plane

I am relistening to Judee Sill's album _Judee Still_. To me it is the 1970s equivalent of a 17th century Spanish Catholic church, strange and gorgeous.

I was introduced to Sill when Drew sent me the song _Jesus Was a Cross Maker_ last year. I wasn't doing well. I listened to this song so many times. When I listen back to it now it still feels like a soft, comforting light in the darkness. 

I am listening to the first song on the album, _Crayon Angels_, while taking the Amtrak Mape Leaf train to visit Maggie in Buffalo. This line strikes me: _So I sit here waitin' / for God and a train / To the Astral plane_. 

Sill released the album in 1971, 5 years before Jonathan Richman released _The Modern Lovers_ in 1976, the second track of which is _Astral Plane_. The song opens: _Tonight I'm all / alone in my room / I'll go insane if you / won't sleep with me / I'll still be with you / I'm gonna meet you on the astral plane_. 

I've never heard of the Astral Plane outside these two songs. I want to know if Richman knew of Sill when writing _Astral Plane_. Judee Sill died of an overdose in 1979, at the age of 35.
